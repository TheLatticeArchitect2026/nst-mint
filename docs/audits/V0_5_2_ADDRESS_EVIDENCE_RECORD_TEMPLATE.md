This document is not a deployment authorization.

This document does not authorize mainnet deployment.

This document does not authorize public production interface launch.

This document does not approve any production address.

This document does not approve any production governance object.

This document does not approve any production treasury route.

This document does not approve any production operator.

This document does not approve any production role owner.

This document does not authorize production configuration.

This document does not authorize production protocol clients.

This document does not authorize production transaction rail execution.

This document does not authorize any public mainnet mint interface.

This document is a template only.

No address entered into a future copy of this template is valid unless the completed record is reviewed, committed, pushed, remotely confirmed, and paired with the required approval evidence.

## Purpose

This template defines the controlled address evidence record format for NST Core v0.5.2.

Every future address used by config, protocol clients, governance gates, transaction rail, public interfaces, corporate interfaces, First Nations interfaces, admin consoles, deployment config, verification commands, or release evidence must be documented using this evidence structure or a stricter successor.

The purpose is to make every address reviewable, auditable, source-controlled, checksum-confirmed, network-scoped, and protected against mock, Anvil, Base Sepolia, screenshot-derived, chat-derived, or placeholder values being treated as production values.

## Current blocker

Production owner addresses remain TBD.

Production governance objects remain TBD.

Production treasury destinations remain TBD.

Production operator assignments remain TBD.

Production role owners remain TBD.

Final deployment configuration remains incomplete.

Final read-only verification receipts remain incomplete.

Final release evidence remains incomplete.

Final human approval remains incomplete.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked.

## Template use rule

A completed address evidence record must be created from this template only after an address is received from an approved source of truth.

Do not use this template to invent addresses.

Do not use this template to approve addresses from memory.

Do not use this template to approve addresses from screenshots.

Do not use this template to approve addresses from chat text.

Do not use this template to approve mock addresses.

Do not use this template to approve local Anvil addresses as production addresses.

Do not use this template to approve Base Sepolia addresses as Base mainnet addresses.

Do not use this template to store private keys.

Do not use this template to store seed phrases.

Do not use this template to store wallet recovery phrases.

Do not use this template to store deployer keys.

Do not use this template to store wallet secrets.

Do not use this template to store private RPC credentials.

## Completed record naming rule

Future completed records should use a deterministic file name.

Recommended naming format:

docs/audits/address-evidence/V0_5_2_ADDRESS_EVIDENCE_<NETWORK>_<CATEGORY>_<SHORT_LABEL>.md

Examples:

- V0_5_2_ADDRESS_EVIDENCE_BASE_SEPOLIA_NSTSBT_CONTRACT.md
- V0_5_2_ADDRESS_EVIDENCE_BASE_SEPOLIA_CFT_CONTRACT.md
- V0_5_2_ADDRESS_EVIDENCE_BASE_MAINNET_GOVERNANCE_MULTISIG.md
- V0_5_2_ADDRESS_EVIDENCE_BASE_MAINNET_TREASURY_MULTISIG.md
- V0_5_2_ADDRESS_EVIDENCE_BASE_MAINNET_FOUNDER_PAYOUT_WALLET.md

A completed production record must not be stored only in an untracked local file.

A completed production record must not be stored only in chat.

A completed production record must not be stored only in a screenshot.
