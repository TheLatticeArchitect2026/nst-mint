## ABI source requirement

Each ABI must come from an approved source under the ABI source policy.

Allowed sources include:

- committed Foundry build artifact from approved build profile;
- source-verified explorer ABI matching deployed Base Sepolia contract;
- release evidence bundle ABI artifact with checksum;
- explicitly reviewed ABI export generated from approved build.

Disallowed sources include:

- screenshots;
- chat text;
- memory;
- guessed ABI fragments;
- manually edited ABI without receipt;
- old build artifacts from unknown commit;
- wrong-branch artifacts;
- wrong-profile artifacts;
- Anvil-only ABIs presented as Base Sepolia;
- Base mainnet ABIs presented as Base Sepolia;
- uncommitted local artifacts;
- private files containing secrets.

## ABI checksum requirement

Each ABI must have a checksum receipt before use by any package or interface.

The checksum receipt must record:

- checksum output value;
- reviewer;
- review date;
- mismatch status;
- no-secret confirmation;

ABI checksum confirmation is not ABI approval.

ABI checksum confirmation does not authorize public demo launch.

ABI checksum confirmation does not authorize write execution.

ABI checksum confirmation does not authorize deployment.

## Address evidence requirement

Each ABI row that relates to a deployed contract must be paired with address evidence.

Address evidence must include:

- deployed address;

Transaction rail may not broadcast transactions using this inventory alone.

Transaction rail may not infer method safety from ABI presence.

Transaction rail may not infer address safety from checksum presence.

Transaction rail may not infer governance approval from Base Sepolia deployment.
