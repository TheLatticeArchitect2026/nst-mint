## Purpose

This checklist defines the controlled gate for the future packages/config source package.

The package is intended to become the public, non-secret, reviewable configuration layer for NST Lattice applications and packages.

This checklist prevents the project from writing executable configuration code before network, address, ABI, feature flag, legal language, public interface, demo, and production boundaries are defined.

The config package must remain blocked until this gate is complete, reviewed, committed, pushed, and referenced in readiness gates.

## Current controlled status

| Area | Current result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| packages/config scaffold | README-only scaffold exists | COMPLETE |
| Config package executable code | Not created | BLOCKED |
| Transaction rail package gate | Created and committed | COMPLETE |
| Protocol client package gate | Created and committed | COMPLETE |
| Base Sepolia inventory | Created and committed | COMPLETE |
| Final production address collection package | Created and committed | COMPLETE |
| Final production address approvals | Not complete | OPEN |
| Production deployment config | Not finalized | BLOCKED |
| Mainnet config | Not authorized | BLOCKED |
| Public production config | Not authorized | BLOCKED |
| Mainnet deployment | Not authorized | BLOCKED |

## Config package scope

The future config package may eventually define public configuration for:

- supported chain IDs;
- supported network names;
- Base Sepolia demo mode;
- Base mainnet production mode after approval;
- local Anvil development mode;
- public contract address maps;
- ABI source references;
- explorer URL templates;
- feature flags;
- app mode flags;
- public warning language;
- testnet disclaimers;
- production disclaimers;
- corporate interface copy;
- First Nations interface boundary copy;
- public site interface copy;
- admin console read-only mode flags;
- transaction rail configuration;
- protocol client configuration;
- governance gate configuration.

The config package must not contain:

- private keys;
- seed phrases;
- wallet recovery phrases;
- deployer keys;
- wallet secrets;
- private RPC credentials;
- privileged signer material;
- production secrets;
- keystore passwords;

- Base Sepolia addresses presented as production addresses;
- Anvil addresses presented as production addresses;
- mock addresses presented as production addresses.

## Public config rule

The config package may contain only public, reviewable, non-secret values.

A value is eligible for config only if it can safely be committed to the public repository.

A value is not eligible for config if disclosure would compromise:

- funds;
- deployer control;
- role ownership;
- wallet custody;
- RPC access;
- treasury routing security;
- governance authority;
- signer recovery;
- operational security.

Every config value must have:

- purpose;
- source document;
- source commit;
- reviewer;
- approval status;
- network scope;
- expiration or review condition where applicable;
- no-secret confirmation.

## Secret exclusion rule

The config package must never include:

- private keys;
- seed phrases;
- wallet recovery phrases;
- wallet secrets;
- deployer keys;
- mnemonic phrases;
- keystore passwords;
- hardware wallet recovery data;
- private RPC credentials;
- private API keys;
- personal access tokens;
- production signing material;
- treasury signing material;
- multisig signer private material;
- private legal correspondence;
- private personal information;
- bank information;
- tax information;
- identity documents.

If any secret appears in config, the config package must be rejected.

If any secret appears in a readiness document, the readiness package must be rejected.

If any secret appears in an app, package, or infra file, the working tree must be stopped and remediated.

## Network config gate

Before config package code is written, network configuration rules must be approved.

Required network config categories include:

- local Anvil development;

- final deployment config checksum is captured;
- final deployment config manual review receipt is captured;

Before those conditions are complete, Base mainnet config must remain absent or marked blocked.

## Contract address config gate

Every contract address config entry must include:

- contract name;
- module;
- network;
- chain ID;

The First Nations lawyer specializing in Treaty law should review config language related to:

- treaty law;
- governance framing;
- rights language;
- consent language;
- representation language;
- revenue language;
- community onboarding;
- disclaimers;
- possible multisig/key-holder role design.

The config package must not encode final First Nations authority assumptions without legal language and governance evidence.

- contract address status;
- role owner status;
- treasury route status;
- pause status;
- mint status;
- metadata freeze status;
- registry status;

Admin console config must not enable write operations before privileged operations review.

## Transaction rail config dependency

The transaction rail depends on config for:

- chain IDs;
- network labels;
- contract address maps;
- explorer URL templates;
- action availability;
- feature flags;
- warning language;
- testnet mode;
- production mode;
- receipt paths.

Transaction rail must not treat missing config as production-ready.
