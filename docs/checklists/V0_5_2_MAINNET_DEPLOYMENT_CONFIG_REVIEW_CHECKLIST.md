## Purpose

This checklist defines the review gate for any future NST Core v0.5.2 mainnet deployment configuration.

This document is not a deployment authorization.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by this checklist.

This checklist does not create a deployment configuration.

This checklist does not add production addresses.

This checklist does not approve any address, route, role, treasury destination, operator, key, deployer wallet, or governance object.

This checklist exists to make sure that a future deployment configuration can only be accepted after every required production address, role, treasury route, operator authority, build profile, verification command, and review receipt has been resolved.

## Current blocker

Production owner addresses remain TBD.

The final deployment configuration is not complete.

The final deployment configuration must not be created from memory, screenshots, chat text, guesswork, mock values, local values, Base Sepolia values, or temporary placeholders.

The final deployment configuration must be created only from approved public production address evidence.

## Security rule

No private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, or private RPC credentials belong in this repository.

No private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, or private RPC credentials belong in any deployment config review receipt.

Only public production addresses, governance objects, route destinations, checksums, approval references, and review receipts may be documented.

## Build profile rule

The current branch has committed Via-IR as the Foundry build profile.

Observed current requirement:

- foundry.toml must contain via_ir = true.
- forge fmt --check must pass.
- forge build must pass under the committed Via-IR config.
- forge test must pass under the committed Via-IR config.
- Deployment scripts must use the approved build profile.
- Verification commands must be compatible with the approved build profile.
- Release scripts must check the approved build profile evidence.

A passing build does not authorize deployment.

A passing test suite does not authorize deployment.

A committed Via-IR build profile does not authorize deployment.

## Deployment config acceptance rule

A future mainnet deployment configuration may be accepted only when all of the following are true:

- The final address intake package contains no TBD production owner values.
- The final owner address template contains no TBD production owner values.
- Every public address is checksum reviewed.
- Every address category has approval evidence.
- Every address matches the role treasury operator matrix.
- Every treasury route matches the treasury owner matrix.
- Every operator permission matches the operator handoff checklist.
- No local, mock, Base Sepolia, or test-only address is used as a production address without explicit written limitation and final approval.
- No private key, seed phrase, API key, wallet secret, deployer key, or recovery phrase appears in any repository file.
- The final deployment config has a checksum receipt.
- The final deployment config has a manual review receipt.
- The final deployment config has a read-only verification plan.
- The final acceptance gate references the completed config review.
- Final human approval is captured.

## v0.5.2 read-only verification commands checklist reference

Source artifact: `docs/checklists/V0_5_2_MAINNET_READ_ONLY_VERIFICATION_COMMANDS_CHECKLIST.md`
Source commit: `b03d4988aa932e9e3556c8d6f950d80bab3111fe`
Referenced from: `b03d4988aa932e9e3556c8d6f950d80bab3111fe`
Recorded UTC: `2026-09-28T09:59:19Z`

This reference does not authorize mainnet deployment.

The read-only verification commands checklist defines the required non-broadcast verification command set for any future NST Core v0.5.2 mainnet candidate package.

Required before deployment:

- Verification commands must be read-only.
- Verification commands must not use `cast send`.
- Verification commands must not use `forge script --broadcast`.
- Verification commands must not require private keys, seed phrases, deployer keys, wallet secrets, or recovery phrases.
- Verification commands must use approved public production contract addresses only after those addresses are finalized.
- Chain identity, contract address, source verification, bytecode verification, owner verification, role verification, treasury route verification, yield route verification, rescue route verification, and release evidence checks must be reviewed before deployment.
- Read-only verification receipts must be captured before any release, deployment, or final approval gate can be marked COMPLETE.

Current status: OPEN until final production addresses, deployment config, verification command receipts, and final human approval are complete.

## V0.5.2 mainnet release evidence bundle checklist reference

Source checklist: `docs/checklists/V0_5_2_MAINNET_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_BUNDLE_CHECKLIST.md`

Release evidence checklist commit: `59da1a7333700290c330d8af33e44e06e47366f9`

Reference created UTC: `2026-09-28T10:27:42Z`

This reference does not authorize deployment.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by this reference.

The mainnet release evidence bundle remains a required blocker gate until every required evidence file, release note, checksum, receipt, GitHub release view, upload confirmation, verification receipt, and final human approval receipt is complete, reviewed, committed, and remotely confirmed.

The release evidence bundle must not contain private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, or private RPC credentials.

The release evidence bundle must not be treated as complete while any of the following remain missing, empty, TBD, unreviewed, uncommitted, or unconfirmed:

- production owner address approval evidence;
- deployment configuration checksum evidence;
- deployment configuration manual review receipt;
- read-only verification command receipts;
- release notes;
- release evidence directory;
- artifact upload confirmation;
- GitHub release view capture;
- rollback evidence;
- final acceptance gate receipt;
- final human approval receipt.

A release evidence bundle checklist pass is required before any future candidate release package can be considered complete.

A release evidence bundle checklist pass does not authorize deployment by itself.

## v0.5.2 final human approval receipt template reference

Reference added UTC: 2026-09-28T11:50:22Z

Source final human approval receipt template: docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_HUMAN_APPROVAL_RECEIPT_TEMPLATE.md

Source template commit: 6ad106ff5eda4ec1d8bf970985ec2c2d58975ea7

This reference does not authorize deployment.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by adding this reference.

Final human approval remains missing until a completed final human approval receipt is reviewed, committed, pushed, remotely confirmed, and supported by all required readiness evidence.

A passing build does not authorize deployment.

A passing test suite does not authorize deployment.

A committed Via-IR build profile does not authorize deployment.

A completed checklist draft does not authorize deployment.

A release evidence bundle checklist does not authorize deployment.

A read-only verification commands checklist does not authorize deployment.

A no-deployment candidate plan does not authorize deployment.

Only a complete final approval package plus explicit human approval can authorize moving toward a candidate deployment command.

Required handling:

- Use docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_HUMAN_APPROVAL_RECEIPT_TEMPLATE.md as the approved structure for any future final human approval receipt.
- Do not substitute chat text, screenshots, passing builds, passing tests, draft checklists, or implied approval for final approval.
- Do not include private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, private RPC credentials, keystore passwords, or hardware wallet recovery information in any approval receipt.
- Keep deployment blocked while any production owner address, governance object, treasury destination, operator assignment, deployment config, verification command, release evidence bundle, rollback path, or final human approval item remains OPEN or TBD.

## V0.5.2 mainnet readiness blocker register reference

Reference source: docs/audits/V0_5_2_MAINNET_READINESS_BLOCKER_REGISTER.md
Reference commit: 54ed452cc3f64cbd6ad69a2b9ed875e9fa5c8f19
Reference UTC: 2026-09-29T08:52:02Z

This document now recognizes the v0.5.2 mainnet readiness blocker register as a controlling readiness artifact.

This reference does not authorize deployment.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked until every blocker in the register is resolved, reviewed, committed, pushed, remotely confirmed, and paired with explicit final human approval.

The blocker register must be checked before any future candidate deployment command is prepared.

## v0.5.2 final production address collection package reference

Reference added UTC: 2026-09-29T20:50:39Z

Reference artifact: docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_PRODUCTION_ADDRESS_COLLECTION_PACKAGE.md

Reference commit: efbf87cf1b199f5fe42026925aa4bdea03663179

Current branch at reference time: phase/v0.5.2-mainnet-readiness

This reference records that the v0.5.2 final production address collection package exists as a committed readiness artifact.

This reference does not approve any production address, route, role, treasury destination, operator, governance object, deployment key, release package, deployment configuration, or mainnet deployment.

This reference does not authorize deployment.

Production owner addresses remain TBD until final public production addresses are collected from an approved source of truth, reviewed, committed, pushed, and remotely confirmed.

No private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, private RPC credentials, keystore passwords, or hardware wallet recovery information belong in this repository.

Do not use screenshots, chat text, mock values, local values, Anvil values, Base Sepolia test-only values, or placeholder addresses as final production values.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked.

## V0.5.2 final production address approval receipt template reference

Reference file: docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_PRODUCTION_ADDRESS_APPROVAL_RECEIPT_TEMPLATE.md
Reference commit: fcfaf82996a48c711d5f9537051ad5a5b91a4291
Reference UTC: 2026-09-30T09:05:59Z

This reference connects the Deployment config review checklist to the final production address approval receipt template.

This reference is not a deployment authorization.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by this reference.

This reference does not approve any production address, route, role, treasury destination, operator, key, deployer wallet, governance object, release package, or deployment configuration.

Final production addresses remain blocked unless each required production address row is paired with a completed approval receipt created from the committed final production address approval receipt template or a stricter committed successor.

Any TBD, placeholder, mock, local, Anvil, Base Sepolia test-only, screenshot-derived, chat-derived, or unapproved address value remains a NO-GO.

No private key, seed phrase, deployer key, wallet secret, API key, recovery phrase, private RPC credential, keystore password, signing material, or hardware wallet recovery information may be documented in this reference chain.

Required approval evidence before this gate can close:

- Completed final production address approval receipt.
- Final public production address values from an approved source of truth.
- Approval evidence for each required owner category.
- Checksum confirmation for each public address.
- Confirmation that no local, mock, Anvil, Base Sepolia test-only, placeholder, screenshot-derived, or chat-derived values are being used as production values.
- Confirmation that no private signing material or secret material is included.
- Manual review receipt.
- Commit and remote confirmation receipt.

Until this approval evidence exists, the production-address portion of this readiness gate remains OPEN and mainnet deployment remains BLOCKED.

## v0.5.2 production address source-of-truth request packet reference

Reference added UTC: 2026-10-02T08:17:08Z
Reference source packet commit: 0b9d98e712085fcbab4618360a316143fd6a7a4b
Reference source packet: docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_PRODUCTION_ADDRESS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_REQUEST_PACKET.md

This reference does not authorize deployment.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by this reference.

The production address source-of-truth request packet is now part of the v0.5.2 readiness evidence chain.

Final production addresses remain unresolved until approved public source-of-truth evidence is collected, reviewed, committed, pushed, remotely confirmed, and converted into a completed final production address approval receipt.

Do not use memory, screenshots, chat text, guesses, placeholder addresses, local addresses, Anvil addresses, mock addresses, Base Sepolia test-only addresses, private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, private RPC credentials, keystore passwords, or hardware wallet recovery information as production address evidence.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked until every final acceptance gate item is COMPLETE, every production owner address is resolved from approved public source-of-truth evidence, and explicit final human approval is captured.

## V0.5.2 source-of-truth response review checklist reference

Reference added UTC: 2026-10-04T11:24:21Z

Source checklist: docs/checklists/V0_5_2_FINAL_PRODUCTION_ADDRESS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_RESPONSE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md

Source checklist commit: c95b21a5263e10154ca9b0aee6ac1225c6d92075

Source checklist short commit: c95b21a

This reference does not authorize deployment.

The production address source-of-truth response review checklist must be completed before any production address response can be accepted into a final owner address template, deployment configuration, verification command set, release evidence bundle, final human approval receipt, or candidate deployment command.

The response review must confirm that every production address comes only from an approved source of truth, has required approval evidence, is checksum reviewed, is not a local mock address, is not an Anvil address, is not a placeholder address, and is not a Base Sepolia or test-only address unless explicitly limited and approved.

No private key, seed phrase, API key, deployer key, wallet secret, recovery phrase, signing material, private RPC credential, keystore password, or hardware wallet recovery information may be included in any response review artifact.

Readiness remains blocked until final public production addresses, approval evidence, deployment configuration review, read-only verification receipts, release evidence, and final human approval are complete, reviewed, committed, pushed, and remotely confirmed.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked.
