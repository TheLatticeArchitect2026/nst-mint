## Purpose

This checklist defines the evidence bundle requirements for any future NST Core v0.5.2 mainnet candidate package.

This document is not a deployment authorization.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by this checklist.

This checklist does not create a release.

This checklist does not publish a GitHub release.

This checklist does not create deployment commands.

This checklist does not approve any address, role, route, treasury destination, operator, key, wallet, or governance object.

This checklist exists to make sure that any future mainnet candidate package has a deterministic, auditable, complete evidence bundle before release creation, final acceptance, or deployment approval.

## Current blocker

Production owner addresses remain TBD.

The final deployment configuration is not complete.

The final read-only verification command set is not complete.

The final release evidence bundle is not complete.

Final human approval has not been captured.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked.

A passing build does not authorize deployment.

A passing test suite does not authorize deployment.

A committed Via-IR build profile does not authorize deployment.

A candidate plan does not authorize deployment.

A release evidence bundle does not authorize deployment.

## Evidence bundle rule

Every future release evidence bundle must be deterministic, reviewable, and reproducible.

Every evidence item must be tied to:

- File path.
- Commit hash.
- Timestamp.
- Reviewer or approving authority.
- Source document.
- Expected result.
- Actual result.
- Status.
- Checksum, where applicable.
- Receipt path, where applicable.

Evidence must not be reconstructed from memory.

Evidence must not be reconstructed from screenshots alone.

Evidence must not be reconstructed from chat text alone.

Evidence must not include private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, or private RPC credentials.

Only public production addresses, governance objects, checksums, command receipts, review receipts, and approval references belong in the evidence bundle.

## Required evidence directory

The default evidence output directory remains:

`NST_Release_Receipts`

The directory must contain only safe public evidence.

No private key material belongs in the evidence directory.

No deployer secret belongs in the evidence directory.

No RPC secret belongs in the evidence directory.

No seed phrase belongs in the evidence directory.

No wallet secret belongs in the evidence directory.

No recovery phrase belongs in the evidence directory.

## Evidence manifest rule

A future candidate package must include a manifest.

The manifest must list every evidence file included in the bundle.

Every manifest row must include:

- Evidence item.
- Source file path.
- Receipt file path.
- Commit hash.
- UTC timestamp.
- Checksum.
- Reviewer or approving authority.
- Status.
- Notes.

Any evidence item with missing source, missing receipt, missing checksum, missing reviewer, or missing status keeps the candidate package blocked.

## v0.5.2 final human approval receipt template reference

Reference added UTC: 2026-09-28T11:50:22Z

Source final human approval receipt template: docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_HUMAN_APPROVAL_RECEIPT_TEMPLATE.md

Source template commit: 6ad106ff5eda4ec1d8bf970985ec2c2d58975ea7

This reference does not authorize deployment.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by adding this reference.

Final human approval remains missing until a completed final human approval receipt is reviewed, committed, pushed, remotely confirmed, and supported by all required readiness evidence.

A passing build does not authorize deployment.

## V0.5.2 mainnet readiness blocker register reference

Reference source: docs/audits/V0_5_2_MAINNET_READINESS_BLOCKER_REGISTER.md
Reference commit: 54ed452cc3f64cbd6ad69a2b9ed875e9fa5c8f19
Reference UTC: 2026-09-29T08:52:02Z

This document now recognizes the v0.5.2 mainnet readiness blocker register as a controlling readiness artifact.

This reference does not authorize deployment.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked until every blocker in the register is resolved, reviewed, committed, pushed, remotely confirmed, and paired with explicit final human approval.

The blocker register must be checked before any future candidate deployment command is prepared.

## v0.5.2 final production address collection package reference

Reference added UTC: 2026-09-29T20:50:39Z

Reference artifact: docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_PRODUCTION_ADDRESS_COLLECTION_PACKAGE.md

Reference commit: efbf87cf1b199f5fe42026925aa4bdea03663179

Current branch at reference time: phase/v0.5.2-mainnet-readiness

This reference records that the v0.5.2 final production address collection package exists as a committed readiness artifact.

This reference does not approve any production address, route, role, treasury destination, operator, governance object, deployment key, release package, deployment configuration, or mainnet deployment.

This reference does not authorize deployment.

Production owner addresses remain TBD until final public production addresses are collected from an approved source of truth, reviewed, committed, pushed, and remotely confirmed.

No private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, private RPC credentials, keystore passwords, or hardware wallet recovery information belong in this repository.

Do not use screenshots, chat text, mock values, local values, Anvil values, Base Sepolia test-only values, or placeholder addresses as final production values.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked.

## V0.5.2 final production address approval receipt template reference

Reference file: docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_PRODUCTION_ADDRESS_APPROVAL_RECEIPT_TEMPLATE.md
Reference commit: fcfaf82996a48c711d5f9537051ad5a5b91a4291
Reference UTC: 2026-09-30T09:05:59Z

This reference connects the Release evidence bundle checklist to the final production address approval receipt template.

This reference is not a deployment authorization.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by this reference.

This reference does not approve any production address, route, role, treasury destination, operator, key, deployer wallet, governance object, release package, or deployment configuration.

Final production addresses remain blocked unless each required production address row is paired with a completed approval receipt created from the committed final production address approval receipt template or a stricter committed successor.

Any TBD, placeholder, mock, local, Anvil, Base Sepolia test-only, screenshot-derived, chat-derived, or unapproved address value remains a NO-GO.

No private key, seed phrase, deployer key, wallet secret, API key, recovery phrase, private RPC credential, keystore password, signing material, or hardware wallet recovery information may be documented in this reference chain.

Required approval evidence before this gate can close:

- Completed final production address approval receipt.
- Final public production address values from an approved source of truth.
- Approval evidence for each required owner category.
- Checksum confirmation for each public address.
- Confirmation that no local, mock, Anvil, Base Sepolia test-only, placeholder, screenshot-derived, or chat-derived values are being used as production values.
- Confirmation that no private signing material or secret material is included.
- Manual review receipt.
- Commit and remote confirmation receipt.

Until this approval evidence exists, the production-address portion of this readiness gate remains OPEN and mainnet deployment remains BLOCKED.

## v0.5.2 production address source-of-truth request packet reference

Reference added UTC: 2026-10-02T08:17:08Z
Reference source packet commit: 0b9d98e712085fcbab4618360a316143fd6a7a4b
Reference source packet: docs/audits/V0_5_2_FINAL_PRODUCTION_ADDRESS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_REQUEST_PACKET.md

This reference does not authorize deployment.

No mainnet deployment is authorized by this reference.

The production address source-of-truth request packet is now part of the v0.5.2 readiness evidence chain.

Final production addresses remain unresolved until approved public source-of-truth evidence is collected, reviewed, committed, pushed, remotely confirmed, and converted into a completed final production address approval receipt.

Do not use memory, screenshots, chat text, guesses, placeholder addresses, local addresses, Anvil addresses, mock addresses, Base Sepolia test-only addresses, private keys, seed phrases, API keys, deployer keys, wallet secrets, recovery phrases, signing material, private RPC credentials, keystore passwords, or hardware wallet recovery information as production address evidence.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked until every final acceptance gate item is COMPLETE, every production owner address is resolved from approved public source-of-truth evidence, and explicit final human approval is captured.

## V0.5.2 source-of-truth response review checklist reference

Reference added UTC: 2026-10-04T11:24:21Z

Source checklist: docs/checklists/V0_5_2_FINAL_PRODUCTION_ADDRESS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_RESPONSE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md

Source checklist commit: c95b21a5263e10154ca9b0aee6ac1225c6d92075

Source checklist short commit: c95b21a

This reference does not authorize deployment.

The production address source-of-truth response review checklist must be completed before any production address response can be accepted into a final owner address template, deployment configuration, verification command set, release evidence bundle, final human approval receipt, or candidate deployment command.

The response review must confirm that every production address comes only from an approved source of truth, has required approval evidence, is checksum reviewed, is not a local mock address, is not an Anvil address, is not a placeholder address, and is not a Base Sepolia or test-only address unless explicitly limited and approved.

No private key, seed phrase, API key, deployer key, wallet secret, recovery phrase, signing material, private RPC credential, keystore password, or hardware wallet recovery information may be included in any response review artifact.

Readiness remains blocked until final public production addresses, approval evidence, deployment configuration review, read-only verification receipts, release evidence, and final human approval are complete, reviewed, committed, pushed, and remotely confirmed.

Mainnet deployment remains blocked.
